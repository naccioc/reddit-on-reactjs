# Reddit on React.js

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- npm 6+
- Reddit API access (more info: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Decisions made
- Use Next.js due to its support for server-side rendering and the ease to use for a mock project
- Material UI components to ease components development and bring a well-known UI. This needed some extra changes over Next.js to properly handle SSR/SSG cases
- Make use of React-Redux store to ease state manipulation across the app
- Use date-fns as dates helper, as it's always hard to handle those in any programming language ðŸ˜°
- Mocked Reddit API per lack of time as it needed to create an account, fill a form with the usage that you'd do of the API and handle OAuth authentication. I prefered to get the app working and with a good UX before that.
